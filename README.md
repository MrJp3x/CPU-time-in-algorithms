# CPU time in algorithms
In each subject, it is checked how each algorithm can affect the CPU time.
For example, in one of the files, the simple multiplication algorithm and the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm are checked.
It can be seen how the complexity of the algorithm can affect the CPU time.

# Algorithms that were reviewed
